Okay so this is going to be a long explanation and I would like it if you kept in mind that while I am tech savy-ish I don't understand a lot about the particular topic. So last week my wifi was running at about 2-5 mbps all over the house my Mom called comcast and they did something on their side and sent a tech guy who replaced a faulty cable.
